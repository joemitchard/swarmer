# swarmer
A zombie apocalypse simulation built using Erlang and Javascript

This simulation was developed for the final year project of our Computer Science degree at the University of Kent.

## Setup
To run the application, clone the repo, run setup and then run swarmer.

Open swarmer.html to start the webside application, and to kick off the swarmer application building an environment in which the simulation will run.

On a Mac, to run the project use the launchswarmer script. This will open swarmer.html for you.

It should work on Windows based systems, though this has as of yet been untested fully.
To setup on Windows, use rebar get-deps, rebar compile, and then run swarmer.bat
