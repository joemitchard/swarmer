# swarmer
A zombie apocalypse simulation built using Erlang and Javascript

This simulation was developed for the final year project of our Computer Science degree at the University of Kent.

## Setup
To run the application, clone the repo, run setup and then run swarmer.

It should work on Windows based systems, though this has as of yet been untested fully.
To setup on Windows, use rebar get-deps, rebar compile, and then run swarmer.bat
